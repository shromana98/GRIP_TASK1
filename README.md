# GRIP_TASKS

Excited to share my latest project as a Data Science Intern and Bussiness Analytics Intern at The Sparks Foundation! ðŸš€
I've developed an Supervised Machine Learning model using linear regression to predict student's scores based on their study hours.

By harnessing the power of data-driven insights, I was able to develop the model with accuracy of 94.54% along with this I also have predicted the score of student who studies 9.25 hours per day and the result was found to be 93.69%ðŸ“ˆðŸ“š
Looking forward to learn and grow more through this internship.

HERES A SGORT VIDEO DEMONSTATION OF THE PROJECT

Hello everyone, I am delighted to announce that I have completed the #task1 of the Data Science and Business Analytics Internship at The Sparks Foundation for the GRIP SEPTEMBER 2023 batch.
I am thankful to The Sparks Foundation for giving me this wonderful opportunity.
Thanks in advance for evaluating my work, any suggestions for improvement will be greatly appreciated.

IDE: Jupyter Lab
Programming Language: Python
Objectives :
1) Exploratory analysis of the data that correlates the marks scored with respect to the number of hours studied.
2) Feature scaling of the independent and dependent variables
3) Development of a regression model with the highest possible accuracy given the computational constraints.
